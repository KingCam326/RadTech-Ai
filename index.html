        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Technology has fascinated me from a young age. As a toddler, I regularly used computers to play games. As I grew older, I began to tinker with my toys and various technologies, including disk players. I would take them apart to understand how they worked and brainstorm ways to improve their functionality. Creating new technology is a dream of mine, and I am deeply passionate about making a positive impact on the world. Through my love for technology and creativity, I aspire to leave behind something that betters the world and creates a lasting legacy.</p>

        <h3>PC Builds</h3>
        <div class="build">
            <h4>Personal Build</h4>
            <img src="images/personal-build.jpg" alt="Personal PC Build" class="build-image">
            <p>I built my own PC using an Optiplex 7020 MT motherboard, a Xeon E3 1271-V3 processor, and 24GB of DDR3 RAM. It also features an XFX RX580 8GB graphics card and a PCI adapter for an NVMe SSD. This is my daily-use computer, optimized to run almost any game or software. I've also used it to run local AI models with smaller parameters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="build">
            <h4>Mid-Tier Build ($700-800)</h4>
            <img src="images/mid-tier-build.jpg" alt="Mid-Tier PC Build" class="build-image">
            <p>My second PC build was a gaming computer featuring an Asus motherboard. I installed an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and 16GB of XLR8 DDR4 RAM, along with a 1TB NVMe SSD. For the GPU, I chose the RX 6600 8GB XFX model. I also replaced the old fans with Corsair's line of fans for better airflow and overall control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="build">
            <h4>Low/Mid-Tier Build ($500)</h4>
            <img src="images/low-mid-tier-build.jpg" alt="Low/Mid-Tier PC Build" class="build-image">
            <p>I also built another gaming computer using the LGA 1150 platform for the CPU, utilizing the Xeon E3 1271-V3 processor once again. I installed 16GB of DDR3 RAM, along with a 1TB NVMe SSD and a 2TB hard drive. The owner wanted to use this computer for gaming, so I chose the RX 6600 GPU, which has proven to be reliable and strong for future upgrades if desired.</p>
